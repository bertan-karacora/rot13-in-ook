# ROT13 in Ook!

In one of my classes, the assignment stated:

> Develop and describe a ROT13 algorithm and program it in pseudocode or a programming language of your choice.

Well, I took that in a literal sense and used the wonderful, Turing-complete [programming language Ook!](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ook!)

Unfortunately, Ook! interpreters are very very rare. However I found a nice (and a little weird) [webpage](https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?lang=en&page=brainfuckOok) that allows to run Ook! code online, out of the box. Just copy-and-paste the code, select "Execute Ook! To text", and input some text to be encrypted. Then click on "Calculate" and stop the execution if it goes into an endless loop. Try it with your bank account data.
